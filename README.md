# Hello_World
I am a creative and adaptable problem solver who thrives on providing data-driven business solutions. As a third-year student at the University of Iowa, I am majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems while minoring in Computer Science, a combination that enables me to apply my technical background to collect, organize, and analyze data to pinpoint and solve business problems. While interning at WindyCity Technologies, I enjoyed working with various teams to enhance business models by performing data analysis and identifying KPIs using Tableau and Power BI. Through these experiences, I was able to develop my passion for bridging the gap between emerging technology and business strategy.
